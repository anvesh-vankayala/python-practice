## Module Polygon.py
- This module has three components
    -   1, Polygon class with : Lazy and one time calculation computes.
    -   2, Iterable and Iterator : with lazy loading of Polygon object.In scenarios where underlying object size is large, in that case entire object list cannot be loaded in RAM. 
    -   3, Counter closure : Instead of using range function, custom counter by specifying start and end of the counts.
